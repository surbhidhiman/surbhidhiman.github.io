I am a computational scientist trained in astrophysics and applied mathematics, working at the intersection of physical modeling, numerical methods, and machine learning.

### Focus Areas
- Scientific and machine-learning-based modeling of physical systems  
- Numerical methods and simulation (ODE-based models, irregular geometries)  
- ML-accelerated simulation and surrogate modeling  
- Cross-domain generalization and representation learning for scientific data
