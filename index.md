Computational scientist with training in astrophysics and applied mathematics, and professional experience building machine learning, optimization, and data-driven systems.

My work sits at the intersection of physical modeling, numerical methods, and machine learning, with an emphasis on translating physical intuition and mathematical formulations into robust computational implementations.

### Focus Areas
- Scientific and machine-learning-based modeling of physical systems  
- Numerical methods and simulation (ODE-based models, irregular geometries)  
- ML-accelerated simulation and surrogate modeling  
- Cross-domain generalization and representation learning for scientific data
