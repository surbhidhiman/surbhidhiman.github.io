## Overview 

I am a scientist with a background in astrophysics and applied mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley. My professional experience includes building machine learning and optimization systems in applied settings. This work integrates physical modeling, numerical methods, and machine learning, with an emphasis on translating mathematical formulations into computational models.

I am currently pursuing an MS in Computational Science at San Diego State University, with a focus on scientific computing and machine-learning–based modeling of physical systems.

I do my best work in environments where research ideas are closely connected to production systems. I am particularly drawn to scientific machine learning and computational modeling, and I value teams that emphasize methodological rigor, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and turning theory into working tools.


## Technical Focus Areas

My technical interests center on applying machine learning to scientific and physical modeling problems, particularly in settings where simulation, numerical methods, and real-world constraints are central.

Areas of focus include:
- ML-based modeling and simulation of physical systems, from formulation through implementation
- Integration of classical numerical solvers with modern machine learning models
- Modeling and inference on irregular grids and complex geometries in simulation contexts


## Background 

I received my undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley, where I studied Astrophysics and Applied Mathematics with an emphasis on quantum mechanics. During this time, I participated in research in computational cosmology, focusing on statistical analysis of large-scale cosmic filaments.

Following graduation, I worked in applied AI and software engineering roles, developing optimization and forecasting systems for supply chain management. This experience deepened my interest in quantitative modeling and in building computational tools that bridge theoretical ideas with practical applications.


## Current Work

My current focus is on modeling physical systems using a combination of classical numerical solvers and modern machine learning approaches. As part of my graduate training at SDSU, I am developing research-oriented thinking that prioritize numerical stability, model validation, interpretability, and reproducibility.

Alongside my graduate work, I continue to work as a data scientist building applied machine learning and forecasting systems, including model development, data engineering, and reproducible Python workflows.


## Tools & Methods

My primary development environments are Python and Julia, with an emphasis on clarity, correctness, and reproducibility.

My experience includes numerical simulation of physical systems, physics-aware machine learning, and optimization-based modeling. I am comfortable reading and contributing to scientific code written in Python, Julia, C++, and Fortran, and I contribute to open-source scientific computing projects.


## Outside of Work 

A few things about me, outside of work: I’m a trained Kathak dancer, a science fiction and fantasy fan, and an enthusiastic hiker in pursuit of waterfalls. I have a soft spot for cosmology, and I’m happiest exploring walkable cities with excellent public transit and nowhere in particular to be.
