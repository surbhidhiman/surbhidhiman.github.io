## Overview 

I am a scientist with a background in astrophysics and applied mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley.My professional experience includes building machine learning and optimization systems in applied settings. My work integrates physical modeling, numerical methods, and machine learning, with a focus on translating mathematics into computational models.

I am currently in a Computational Science MS program at San Diego State University, with a focus on scientific computing and ML based modeling of physical systems. 

I do my best work in environments where research ideas are closely connected to building real systems. I’m especially drawn to work in scientific machine learning and computational modeling, and I value teams that care about careful methods, collaboration across fields, and turning theory into working tools.


## Technical Focus Areas

I work on applying machine learning to scientific and physical modeling problems, particularly where simulation, numerical methods, and real-world constraints matter. I’m especially interested in combining traditional numerical solvers with modern ML to build models that generalize across systems and scales.

Areas of focus include:
- ML based modeling and simulation of physical systems, from formulation to implementation  
- Integration of classical numerical solvers with modern ML models  
- Modeling and inference on irregular grids and complex geometries in simulation-driven settings  


## Background 

I received my undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley, where I studied Astrophysics and Applied Mathematics, with an emphasis on quantum mechanics. During this time, I participated in research in computational cosmology, focusing on statistical analysis of large-scale cosmic structures called filaments. 

Post-undergrad, I worked in applied AI and software engineering roles, developing optimization and forecasting systems for supply chain management. This experience strengthened my interest in quantitative modeling and in building computational tools that bridges theory with practical applications. 


## Current Work

My current work focuses on modeling physical systems using a combination of classical numerical solvers and modern machine learning approaches. As part of my graduate training at SDSU, I am developing research-oriented methods that prioritize numerical stability, model validation, interpretability, and reproducibility.

Alongside my graduate work, I continue to work as a data scientist building applied machine learning and forecasting systems, including model development, data engineering, and reproducible Python workflows.


## Tools & Methods

I build computational models and machine learning systems primarily in Python and Julia, with a focus on clarity, correctness, and reproducibility.

My work includes numerical simulation of physical systems, physics-aware machine learning, and optimization-based modeling. I am comfortable reading and contributing to scientific code written in Python, Julia, C++, and Fortran, and I contribute to open-source scientific computing projects.


## Outside of Work 

Outside of work, my interests oscillate between the very small and the very large. I’m a trained Kathak dancer, a science fiction and fantasy fan, and an enthusiastic hiker in pursuit of waterfalls. I have a soft spot for cosmology, and I’m happiest exploring walkable cities with excellent public transit and nowhere in particular to be.
