## Overview 

I am a computational scientist with training in astrophysics and applied mathematics, and professional experience building machine learning, optimization, and data-driven systems. My work sits at the intersection of physical modeling, numerical methods, and machine learning, with an emphasis on translating physical intuition and mathematical formulations into robust, reproducible computational implementations.

I am currently completing an M.S. in Computational Science at SDSU, with a focus on scientific computing and machine-learning-based modeling of complex systems.

I am interested in research or research-adjacent roles at AI startups or national laboratories, particularly positions focused on scientific machine learning, large-scale modeling, or computational simulation. I am especially drawn to environments that value methodological rigor, interdisciplinary collaboration, and close alignment between theory and implementation.


## Technical Focus Areas

My technical interests center on applying machine learning and computational methods to scientific and physical systems, particularly in settings that require scalable modeling, simulation, and generalization across domains. I am especially interested in approaches that integrate numerical solvers, data-driven models, and representation learning to address complex, high-dimensional problems.

Areas of focus include:
- Machine-learning-based modeling and simulation of physical systems
- Scientific and physics-informed machine learning
- Learning on irregular grids and complex geometries
- Cross-domain generalization and transfer in physical systems
- ML-accelerated simulation and surrogate modeling
- Self-supervised and representation learning for scientific data
- Integration of numerical methods with modern ML architectures


## Background 

I received my undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley, where I studied astrophysics and applied mathematics, with an emphasis on quantum mechanics and mathematical modeling. During this time, I conducted research in computational astrophysics and cosmology, including work on black hole microlensing models and statistical analysis of large-scale cosmic structures.

Following my undergraduate training, I worked in applied AI and software engineering roles, developing machine learning, optimization, and forecasting systems for real-world decision-making problems. This experience strengthened my interest in rigorous quantitative modeling and in building computational tools that bridge theoretical formulations and practical implementation, motivating my pursuit of graduate training in computational science.


## Current Work 

My current work focuses on computational modeling of physical systems using a combination of classical numerical solvers and modern machine learning approaches, with the goal of developing scalable, generalizable scientific models. As part of my graduate training, I am developing research-oriented workflows that emphasize numerical stability, model validation, interpretability, and reproducibility.

In parallel, I continue to work as a data scientist on applied machine learning and forecasting systems, with an emphasis on model development, data engineering, and reproducible Python-based pipelines.


## Tools & Methods 

My work centers on Python-based scientific computing and machine learning, with a strong emphasis on numerical rigor, reproducibility, and transparent model evaluation. I am comfortable working within research codebases and contributing to scientific computing projects spanning multiple programming languages with attention to numerical stability, model validation, and interpretability in physically grounded settings.

My experience includes:
- Numerical methods for ODE-based modeling and simulation
- Scientific and physics-informed machine learning
- Computational modeling of physical systems, including equations of state and fluid dynamics
- Optimization and probabilistic modeling
- Research-oriented software development in Python, with working knowledge of Julia, C++, and Fortran in scientific computing contexts

I have also contributed to open-source scientific software, including numerical simulation tools in the Julia ecosystem.


## Outside of Work 

Outside of work, my interests oscillate between the very small and the very large. I’m a trained Kathak dancer, a science fiction and fantasy fan, and an enthusiastic hiker in pursuit of waterfalls. I have a soft spot for cosmology, and I’m happiest exploring walkable cities with excellent public transit and nowhere in particular to be.
