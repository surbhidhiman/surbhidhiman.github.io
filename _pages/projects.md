### Scientific Machine Learning for Physical Systems
###### *Graduate Research (In Progress)*
I am developing computational models of physical systems that combine classical numerical solvers with machine-learning-based approaches. This work focuses on starting from physically motivated formulations, solving the resulting models numerically, and exploring how learning-based methods can complement traditional simulation techniques.

**Methods**: numerical ODE solvers, PINNs, scientific ML, Python/Julia

### Timeseries Forecasting and Probabilistic Risk Modeling
###### *Industry Project*
I designed forecasting and probabilistic risk modeling systems to predict the evolution of time-dependent metrics and to quantify uncertainty around those predictions. This work involved leading a team to forecast problems quantitatively, develop models that balance accuracy and interpretability, and build supporting pipelines for data ingestion, validation, and analysis.

**Methods**: timeseries modeling, probabilistic forecasting, Python, SQL

### Optimization for Invenory Replenishment 
###### *Industry Project*
I built optimization models for inventory replenishment recommendations. This work required translating real-world constraints into formal objective functions, designing solution approaches that were computationally tractable, and integrating these models into production systems.

**Methods**: optimization, simulation, algorithmic modeling, Python

### Air Quality Forecasting and Public Health Impact Analysis
###### *Women in AI Incubator Program*
As part of a voluntary Women in AI data science incubator program at my place of employment, I contributed to a collaborative project investigating whether air quality metrics can be quantitatively linked to public health outcomes. The project focused on forecasting pollutant concentrations using both classical and deep learning approaches and assessing potential causal relationships with public health indicators using California based datasets.

**Methods**: timeseries forecasting (SARIMA, LSTM), causal analysis, environmental data, Python

### Computational Modeling in Astrophysics
###### *Academic & Undergraduate Research*
During my undergraduate studies, I developed computational models for astrophysical phenomena such as large-scale cosmic filaments at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This project provided early experience in connecting physical intuition, mathematical formulation, and computational implementation.

**Methods**: mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, Python

### Open-Source Scientific Computing Contribution
###### *Community Contribution*
I contributed to an open-source numerical simulation codebase in the Julia ecosystem, focusing on model implementation and testing.

**Methods**: scientific software, numerical simulation, Julia
