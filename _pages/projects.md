## Scientific Machine Learning for Physical Systems
#### Graduate Project (In Progress)

Developing computational models of physical interactions using a combination of classical numerical methods and machine-learning-based approaches. This work focuses on formulating physically motivated models, solving the resulting systems using ODE-based numerical solvers, and exploring physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a complementary modeling approach.

Emphasis is placed on numerical stability, validation against known regimes, and building reproducible Python-based research workflows that integrate scientific computing and modern ML techniques.

Methods: ODE solvers, physics-informed ML, numerical modeling, Python-based scientific workflows



## ML-Accelerated Forecasting and Probabilistic Modeling
#### Industry Project

Designed and implemented forecasting and probabilistic modeling systems to predict the evolution of key metrics over time and quantify uncertainty relative to dynamic targets. This work involved translating problem requirements into quantitative formulations, developing predictive models, and evaluating performance under varying assumptions and data regimes.

In addition to model development, this project included building end-to-end pipelines for data ingestion, feature engineering, validation, and visualization, with an emphasis on interpretability and decision support.

Methods: time-series modeling, probabilistic forecasting, model validation, Python, SQL


## Optimization and Simulation for Decision-Making Systems
#### Industry Project

Developed optimization-based systems to support large-scale operational decision-making, including network and combinatorial optimization formulations. This work required designing objective functions and constraints grounded in real-world system behavior, implementing efficient solution strategies, and integrating these models into production software systems.

The project highlighted the importance of balancing theoretical optimality with computational tractability and robustness in applied settings.

Methods: optimization, algorithmic modeling, simulation, Python-based implementation


## Computational Modeling in Astrophysics
#### Academic & Undergraduate Research

Built and analyzed computational models for astrophysical phenomena, including black hole microlensing and large-scale cosmic structure. This work involved implementing mathematical and statistical models, analyzing simulation outputs, and interpreting results in a physical context.

These projects provided early experience translating physical intuition into computational form and laid the foundation for later work in scientific computing and modeling.

Methods: mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, scientific computing, Python
